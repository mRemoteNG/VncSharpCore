# VncSharp

VncSharp is a Free and Open Source (GPL) implementation of the VNC Remote Framebuffer (RFB) Protocol for the .NET Framework. [VNC] (Virtual Network Computing) is a cross-platform client/server protocol allowing remote systems to be controlled over a network. VNC was originally developed at A
T&T Laboratories in Cambridge and is now being developed by RealVNC in the UK. You [can download] VNC clients and servers from RealVNC's website, or from a number of other parallel development projects.

VncSharp is a VNC Client Library and custom Windows Forms Control. VncSharp is also Free Software, released under the GPL. You can freely use VncSharp to bundle VNC functionality into your own .NET applications simply by dragging and dropping a control onto your form.

VncSharp was originally (https://github.com/humphd/VncSharp) written by David Humphrey (david.humphrey@senecac.on.ca) with contributions from many others (see CHANGELOG).
As it is being used in mRemoteNG it still receives occasional updates when necessary.
